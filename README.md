# [LibreMesh][5] packages

[![LibreMesh logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libremesh/lime-web/master/logo/logo.png)](https://libremesh.org)

[LibreMesh project][5] includes the development of several tools used for
deploying libre/free mesh networks.

The firmware (the main piece) will allow simple deployment of auto-configurable,
yet versatile, multi-radio mesh networks. Check the [Network Architecture][4] to
see the basic ideas.

We encourage each network community to create its firmware profile on
[network-profiles][10] repository and build the images locally.


## Supported hardware

[In this page][1] we provide a list of requirements that ensure you to have a
working LibreMesh node on your router. This list comes with no warranties: read
carefully the [model-specific instructions on OpenWrt wiki][OpenWrt-ToH] and be
extra-careful when flashing your routers!

## Building a Firmware Image on Your PC

### Building the stable release LibreMesh 2020.1

#### Using the BuildRoot

The BuildRoot **will cross-compile the whole OpenWrt and the LibreMesh packages** on your computer, so it will take approx 10 GB of disk space and a few hours of compilation time.

For compiling LibreMesh firmware with this method, you can follow [these instructions][development_page].

#### Using the ImageBuilder

The ImageBuilder method is not available for the stable release.

### Building the experimental firmware

The experimental code still has serious issues that have to be solved, use it only for developing or debugging.

#### Using the BuildRoot

As explained above, in the instuctions on the website you will find where to specify the version of the code to compile.

#### Using the ImageBuilder

The ImageBuiler **will download pre-compiled parts of the OpenWrt releases**, and add the pre-compiled LibreMesh packages, so it is **much faster** than the BuildRoot method (but less practical if you want to develop some new features modifying LibreMesh source code).

Start an ImageBuilder of your choice, for example ath79-generic if your device is supported within it, use containers for an easier setup:

```shell
mkdir ./images/
docker run -it -v $(pwd)/images:/images/ ghcr.io/openwrt/imagebuilder:ath79-generic-v22.03.5
```

If your device is not part of ath79-generic profiles, you can replace it with another <target>-<subtarget> combination. For knowing which target and subtarget is best suited for your router, check out the page about it in the [OpenWrt's Table of Hardware][OpenWrt-ToH].

Within the container, add the `lime-packages` feed:

```shell
echo "src/gz libremesh https://feed.libremesh.org/master" >> repositories.conf
echo  "untrusted comment: signed by libremesh.org key a71b3c8285abd28b" > keys/a71b3c8285abd28b
echo "RWSnGzyChavSiyQ+vLk3x7F0NqcLa4kKyXCdriThMhO78ldHgxGljM/8" >> keys/a71b3c8285abd28b
```

Ideally add your own `lime-community` files within the container in the folder
`./files/etc/config/`. To find possible options consult the
[lime-example.txt][lime-example] file. It is also possible to mount an existing
`lime-community` file directly via `-v
$(pwd)/lime-community:/builder/files/etc/config/lime-community`.

Now create an image of your choice, to see the names of supported profiles run
`make info` first.

```shell
make image PROFILE=ubnt_unifi PACKAGES="lime-system lime-proto-babeld lime-proto-batadv lime-proto-anygw lime-hwd-openwrt-wan -dnsmasq" BIN_DIR=/images FILES=files
```

Your images should be available outside of the container in the `./images/` folder

##### Possible errors from the ImageBuilder

If you get a `docker: Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock. Is the docker daemon running?.` error, means that you don't have Docker's daemon running. Make sure you have `docker` installed and start its daemon with `systemctl start docker.service`.

If you get a `opkg_download: Check your network settings and connectivity.` error, both check the connectivity and make sure that the firewall rules of your computer allow the container to reach the internet.


## Testing

LibreMesh has unit tests that help us add new features while keeping maintenance
effort contained.

To run the tests simply execute `./run_tests`.

Please read the [[Unit Testing Guide](TESTING.md)] for more details about
testing and how to add tests to LibreMesh.
